The buildmanager requires the use of setuptools. 

Setup tools can be easily installed using pip.  Which should be located in the scripts directory of your python installation.
pip install setuptools

These packages are required by nornir_buildmanager:

  numpy, scipy : http://www.scipy.org/ 
  matplotlib : http://matplotlib.org/ (Plotting)

ImageMagick must be on the path for the build manager to work properly.
